# Traffic Sign Classification


This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify traffic signs. 
The main objective is to develop a model capable of identifying and categorizing 
different types of traffic signs from images, providing a useful tool for road 
assistance applications and autonomous vehicles.

We used two datasets from Kaggle:
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-preprocessed/data
  
These datasets contain over 80,000 images classified into 43 categories.
